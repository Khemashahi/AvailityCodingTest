1.	Tell me about your proudest professional achievement. It can also be a personal or school project.
Response: For me, the proudest professional achievement was when I worked as a second lead in a team of developers to create a complex and robust software application for a major financial institution. The project involved building a secure and scalable platform that could handle millions of transactions per day and integrate with multiple legacy systems.
I was responsible for the design and development of the core modules, as well as overseeing the work of my team members. We used the latest Java technologies and frameworks, such as Spring and Hibernate, to ensure the application was fast, reliable, and easy to maintain. I did the main coding and look over my team to make sure they are doing it right.
While doing the job, we faced many challenges, like tight deadlines, changing requirements, and unexpected technical issues. But I worked hard with my team and overcame those challenges by working closely with my team, communicating effectively with stakeholders, and staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends and best practices.
In the end, we delivered the project on time and within budget, exceeding the client's expectations. The application is now being used by a lot of customers, and I am proud to have been a part of such a successful and impactful project.

2.	Tell me about something you have read recently that you would recommend and why. (Can be a Github Repo, Article, Blog, Book, etc)
Response: I recently read "Atomic Habits" by James Clear, and I would highly recommend it. The book talks about how to build good habits and break bad ones, using a step-by-step approach, and I think it was very helpful for me.
What I liked the most about the book is that it emphasizes the importance of making small, incremental changes in our daily routines, instead of trying to make big changes all at once. If we focus and improve our tiny habits, we can make good improvements in our lives.
The author also explains the science behind habit formation and provides real-life examples and case studies. The book is easy to read and have many tips we can use for health, work, fitness, relationship, and so on. 
Overall, I found "Atomic Habits" to be a very insightful and useful book, and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking to improve their habits and achieve their goals.

3.	How would you explain to your grandmother what Availity does?
Response:  "Availity is a company that helps people who work in healthcare, like doctors and nurses, to share information with each other. They have developed computer programs that make it easier for different hospitals and doctor's offices to talk to each other and share important information about patients. This is really helpful because sometimes patients need to see different doctors or go to different hospitals, but it's hard for the doctors to share information about the patient's health. Availity makes it easier for them to do that.
Availity also helps health insurance companies and other people who pay for healthcare to work together better. They have a special system that helps them talk to each other and share information about things like how much a doctor should get paid for doing a certain procedure. This helps to make sure that everyone is on the same page and that things are fair for everyone.
Overall, Availity is a company that helps make things easier and more organized in the healthcare world. It helps doctors and nurses share information, and it helps insurance companies and other people who pay for healthcare work together better. This is really important because it means that people can get better care, and everyone can work together more effectively."
